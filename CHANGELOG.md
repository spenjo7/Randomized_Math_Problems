## 2021-12-08: Adding specific .html pages for each type of Math operation ( Adding, Subtraction, Multiplication,  and Division). Previously there was only one .html page, which created one column of randomized questions for each operation Type.

## 2021-12-22: MAJOR REFACTOR!
Adding options to set some of the variables via html querystring inputs. See the README.md for more details!
To facilitate some of those changes, the bodies of the HTML files so that they have almost no code in them.
The .html files were renamed for clearer identification. Additionally there are now 'mixed' .html files with two or more math question types.
